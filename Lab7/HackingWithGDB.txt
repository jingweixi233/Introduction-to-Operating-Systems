It is so fun.
In common, the function call will use the stack.
The stack has the buffer to store data and store the return address of function.
The hacker will use the bug of stack.
He will make a big data to make the buffer overflow.
Then it will overwrite your address of function to return.
Then the function will return to the program that hacker want you to execute.
What a clever method to hack attacking.
