Linux Basic

In this lab, we will go through the steps to setup a virtual machine (VM) on your own computer. This allows you to work in a Linux environment, regardless of the operating system (OS) running on your computer. We call the OS running on your computer the host OS, and the OS running in an VM the guest OS. Also, we include some basics of Linux and VirtualBox, which hopefully prepare you to work in a Linux environment.
